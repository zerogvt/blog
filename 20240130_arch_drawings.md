In any architecture diagrams you should note and make clear what are the inputs and outputs of the system (e.g. bold letters).
E.g. kafka topics, redis keys, files on disk or cloud, HTTP or RPC calls, user input.

That way it is much easier for the future maintainers and operations to quickly get an overview of your system and minimizes any surprises to them.
